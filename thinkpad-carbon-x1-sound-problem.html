Thinkpad X1 Carbon 7Gen  (Qubes and Fedora)

The main problem right now is the microphone, no way to activate it (a part from using headphone ..
but then you can speak but you can't hear!)

the scenario:
$ lspci --nnk | grep A2 audio
$ lsmod | grep 'snd_'
$ sudo dmesg | grep -i audio    # to inspect some error

Not fixed yet ... it's a long road ..
